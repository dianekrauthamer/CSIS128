<h3>Recent releases</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>This Packed Funeral</strong> (2014): <em>"The band is still mature, but now they are backed by a powerful sense of confidence and conviction. The result is the band's most ambitious album to date. The side effect, simply, is that once again the band is having fun. A lot of it." - PunkNews.org</em>
</li>
<li><strong>The Anarchy and the Ecstasy</strong> (2011): <em>"The unthinkable has happened: The World/Inferno Friendship Society is maturing. Although the punk/cabaret act has a long history of rampaging through life and living for the day, it seems that on The Anarchy and the Ecstasy, they are realizing that actions have consequences." - PunkNews.org</em></li>
<li><strong>Addicted to Bad Ideas: Peter Lorre's Twentieth Century</strong> (2007): <em>"The World/Inferno Friendship Society stay faithful to the concept behind the album, and despite the inherent sadness in the tale they brilliantly narrate, the band's enthusiasm helps to turn the tale into a strangely uplifting record which is not only a stunning testament to Peter Lorre's legacy, but also a wonderful album in itself." - PunkNews.org</em></li></li>
