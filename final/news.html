<br><br>PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Musicians have been walking picket lines on both ends of Pennsylvania with strikes at orchestras in Pittsburgh and now Philadelphia.
<br>
<br>The Philadelphia Orchestra went on strike Friday night, canceling an opening night performance that about 1,000 people had come to hear.
<br><br>
The walkout came only hours after another one by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. Weekend concerts scheduled in both cities have been canceled.
<br><br>
The Philadelphia Orchestra musicians represented by the American Federation of Musicians Local 77 posted a statement on Facebook saying they must be able to attract top talent in order to remain one of the nation's great orchestras.
<br><br>
Pickets popped up outside grocery stores across the country. At least two food co-ops took Driscoll's off their shelves. This growing pressure, along with ongoing direct action in the fields workers organized four strikes this year alone-brought Sakuma to the table.
<br><br>
The Philadelphia Orchestra Association says any agreement "will have great and lasting consequences" for the orchestra's future and it hopes to come to a speedy agreement with the musicians. <br><br><a href="http://www.wkyt.com/content/news/Orchestra-musicians-on-strike-in-Philadelphia-Pittsburgh-395516721.html" target="_blank">View the original story.</a>

<br><br>Two years after their contentious battle to form a union, home-health workers have begun contract negotiations that are likely to center on Minnesota’s chronic and worsening shortage of people willing to care for the state’s most vulnerable and frail residents.
<br><br>
Clutching banners that read, “Fix the Homecare Crisis,” activists with the union representing some 20,000 home care workers converged on the State Capitol this week, calling for major improvements in a state-funded program that helps nearly 30,000 residents who are elderly or disabled live in their own homes.
<br><br>
The negotiations that began Friday are expected to focus on improving wages and working conditions in a profession that typically pays just $10 to $13 an hour, often with few benefits. Such improvements could cost state taxpayers tens of millions of dollars annually, but the shortage of home health workers has reached emergency proportions across the state, as home care aides jump to better-paying and more permanent positions in nursing homes, hospitals and other facilities.
<br><br>
“The pool of people willing to do this kind of work has shrunk dramatically,” said Oriane Casale, a labor market analyst with the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development.
<br><br>
The shortage has put unprecedented strain on people with chronic illnesses and severe disabilities.

<br><br>After three years of tireless organizing, 500 farmworkers at Sakuma Brothers Farms in Washington state have finally won union recognition.
<br>
<br>The berry pickers, mainly indigenous migrants from Mexico, began their fight with a work stoppage in 2013 and never let up.
<br><br>
They formed an independent union, Familias Unidas por la Justicia, and launched boycotts against Sakuma and its major client, multinational berry distributor Driscoll's, calling for the farm to recognize the union and negotiate.
<br><br>
This year the boycott went international, as the Washington workers joined in solidarity with berry pickers in San Quintin, Mexico, who have led massive strikes for higher wages and benefits and against sexual harassment on the job.
<br><br>
Pickets popped up outside grocery stores across the country. At least two food co-ops took Driscoll's off their shelves. This growing pressure, along with ongoing direct action in the fields workers organized four strikes this year alone-brought Sakuma to the table.
<br><br>
Farmworkers are excluded from the labor law that guarantees organizing rights to most private sector workers in the U.S. They can't follow the usual route to unionize by filing with the National Labor Relations Board for an election. But that doesn't mean farmworkers can't build pressure on their employer to recognize a union.
<br><br>
Sakuma agreed to an election and on September 12, workers voted yes by an overwhelming 77 percent. It's a rare win for an independent local farmworker union. <br><br><a href="http://labornotes.org/2016/09/farmworkers-taste-fruits-victory" target="_blank">Read the full story in <em>Labor Notes</em></a>
